2 + 2
# Addition → 2 plus 2 = 4

4 - 2
# Subtraction → 4 minus 2 = 2

9 * 10
# Multiplication → 9 times 10 = 90

4 // 10
# Floor division → 4 divided by 10 = 0 (no decimal, just the integer part)

920 // 10
# Floor division → 920 divided by 10 = 92

30 // 2
# Floor division → 30 divided by 2 = 15

10 / 5
# Division → 10 divided by 5 = 2.0 (regular division with float result)

8 ** 2
# Exponentiation → 8 to the power of 2 = 64

10 % 10
# Modulus → remainder of 10 divided by 10 = 0

10 + 20 * 5
# Follows operator precedence (PEMDAS): 20 * 5 = 100, then 10 + 100 = 110

(10 ^ 20) + (10 * 25)
# Bitwise XOR (not power): 10 ^ 20 = 30, 10 * 25 = 250 → 30 + 250 = 280
